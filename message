# Hi there,

# I don't know if this is inappropriate, and if it is I apologize, but github doesn't make it possible to message people directly. My name is Richard and I’m just getting back into DR after a 10+ year hiatus. I played pretty obsessively for the time before that. Ironically enough, I’m signed up to begin a coding bootcamp with an emphasis on Ruby and found your client after doing a little research on what is available these days. I’d love to ask some questions about how it works and how to utilize all this information if you’re willing and available.

# Thank you in advance and again I apologize if this was the wrong way to communicate with you.
